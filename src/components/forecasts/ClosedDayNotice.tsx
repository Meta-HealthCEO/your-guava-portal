/**
 * A day the engine forecasts at zero because the trading hours say the cafe is
 * shut, on a weekday the sales record says it trades.
 *
 * The engine has always known this - `availability.contradictsHistory` is set
 * the moment the forecast is generated - but nothing rendered it, so a
 * mis-set weekday looked like a quiet day rather than a broken setting. On the
 * seeded cafe that was eight Sundays scoring 0%, which is most of the gap
 * between the 77% the product reports and the 90% it is capable of.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the closure agrees with history: a cafe that genuinely
 * shuts on Mondays must not be nagged about Mondays. The backend's own reason
 * is the message, because it is the side that counted the sales.

 * One classification of a forecast's factors, shared by Today's impact gauges
 * and the Planning drawer's "Why this prediction?".
 *
 * Three states look identical if you only read `factor.active`: a factor the
 * plan does not include, one the owner switched off in factor rules, and one
 * that ran and happened to move nothing today. The drawer used to render all
 * three as a muted "no effect", so a Starter customer concluded payday did not
 * matter this week when in truth it was never evaluated. Today's dashboard
 * already told them the opposite. Keeping the rule in one place is what stops
 * the two surfaces disagreeing about the same forecast.
